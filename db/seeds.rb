# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
# actor = Actor.new(first_name: "Les", last_name: "Grossman", known_for: "Tropic Thunder")
# actor.save

#Hells yes!!! Added Les via the console and Pink via the seed file! It's on bitches! =)

# actor = Actor.new(first_name: "Pink", last_name: "Panther", known_for: "Pink Panther")
# actor.save
